</ul>
<p>Our team goal for Sprint 2 was to completely build all the
functionality of the entire site so that we could devote Sprint 3 to
design elements. We overestimated our velocity and encountered
obstacles that slowed our progress, resulting in a backlog of Sprint
2 functionality build-out yet to be done as of the start of Sprint
3. This led to a high number of story points for Sprint 3, and
required significant effort.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Sprint 3 a new set of user stories were added to
our backlog.  First, event hosts wanted ways to solicit donations to
help fund their parties via the online system. Second, product
owners wanted to see which page presentation maximized those
donations, and from whom donations of a significant size were likely
to come. These stories required development of A:B testing and
analytics infrastructure that we had not anticipated in our original
Sprint 3 planning.</p>
<p>Resultingly, Sprint 3 became dominated by functionality build-out,
despite prior plans to reserve the time for cosmetic elements of
site presentation. MightyLake was able to produce a fully-functional
product that passes all required tests, enables donations, observes
the results of A:B testing, returns some analytics to the site
owners, and has some CSS style elements.</p>
<h4>Product Backlog</h4>
<ul>
<li>None — The software delivery is made as of the time of this report</li>
</ul>
<p>Sprint 3 concludes our work on this project, and there is no
official remaining backlog. Were we to continually iterate our site,
wish list items that would likely find their way into our backlog
include improved appearance via more robust CSS styling, more robust
analytic testing of user behavior, and subsequent content redesigns
based on donation behavior indications revealed by the analytics.</p>
<h4>Project Retrospective</h4>
<p>Completing the Eventbrite clone project imparted and/or reinforced
several things covered in the course in a way that anything other
than completing a project may not have:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Coordination a la scrum is important.</strong> Our team used Waffle to
track user stories and their delegation, which was a good tool that
met our basic needs well. We did not—at least initially—do much
additional communication such as daily stand-up meetings or sprint
debriefing sessions. Our experience eschewing these scrum elements
highlighted the value they impart when Sprint 2 challenges delayed
work—challenges that could probably have been overcome more quickly
by voicing them and briefly crowdsourcing potential solutions.
Similarly, skipped sprint debriefing sessions led to over-ambition
with regard to story points to continue (although in our
deadline-constrained context with only three sprints, that may not
have been able to be different because by the time we realized our
velocity misjudgement, we were entering the final sprint and had to
complete all remaining stories regardless).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing a common physical space would be helpful.</strong> Our team
worked remotely, which enabled communication gaps to endure. A
shared workspace may have been preferable form a productivity
standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Version control and code reviews are essential.</strong> Our team
spanned programming skillsets from experienced programmer to
complete novice. The novice on the team had a steep learning curve,
and pushed borked code on several occasions. The ability—built into
the tools—to perform code reviews, accept or reject a pull request,
and/or revert to an earlier version when the novice merged borked
code proved very important.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to those points, our experience on the project presented
a challenge around differing levels of coding proficiency. There was
a stark difference in our skillsets, which was handled gracefully,
but was nevertheless a challenge, and would not have been
encountered (at least not to such an extreme degree) in a real-world
programming context.</p>
<p>Finally, our experience revealed the benefit of programming CSS
stylistic elements alongside functional HTML code. We designed our
workflow to produce 100% working code (the graded portion of the
project) before devoting energy to stylistic (nongraded) elements.
Going back in to style HTML components after the fact was more
challenging than it may have been to style them concurrently,
avoiding the need to retrace steps.</p>
<h4>Traffic Analysis</h4>
<p>The data our team gathered through traffic analysis was largely
inconclusive.  Despite beginning to setup multiple analytics
platforms starting on Thursday 2/12, we did not gather any valid
data until Tuesday 2/17.  This was partly due to issues on our end,
but was mainly influenced by issues outside of our control.  Users
stopped visiting the website over the weekend, and didn&#39;t return to
their regular flow.</p>
<p>Users to our site seemed completely unwilling to donate.  (This was
not the expected result, we did have a valid donation link, and had
confirmed that the behavior tracking properly followed <em>real</em> users
all the way through the process from index page to donation).</p>
<p>There was some data gathered from the index page AB test.  Version A
presented links to event detail pages containing the prefix &quot;RSVP
to&quot;, while version B presented links with only the title of the
event.</p>
<p>The data gathered is summarized below, by referrer and version:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Referrer</th>
<th>Showing RSVP</th>
<th>Visits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.yale.edu/">http://www.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.yale.edu/">http://www.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>43</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="http://som.yale.edu/">http://som.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>34</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://som.yale.edu/">http://som.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>28</td>

<td>TRUE</td>
<td>5</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="http://medicine.yale.edu/">http://medicine.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>FALSE</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/">http://www.law.yale.edu/</a></td>
<td>TRUE</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We see some slight increase in visits for the pages showing RSVP,
but upon brief statistical analysis, we conclude that this
difference, given the limited quantity of data, isn&#39;t significant.</p>
<p>If we had data from a longer time period, and more data points, we
may have been able to draw a stronger conclusion from this
difference.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Referrer</th>
<th>Sample Probability</th>
<th>P-Value</th>
<th>95% Confidence Interval</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.yale.edu">http://www.yale.edu</a></td>
<td>0.54</td>
<td>0.267</td>
<td>0.447 - 1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://som.yale.edu">http://som.yale.edu</a></td>
<td>0.55</td>
<td>0.263</td>
<td>0.436 - 1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://medicine.yale.edu">http://medicine.yale.edu</a></td>
<td>0.56</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.25 - 1.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This shows the results of a binomial test with the alternative
hypothesis that the true probability of clicking a link with RSVP is
greater than 0.5, and thus we should show the link.</p>
<p>The p-value column indicates the chance that this same result
occurred randomly.  In all cases, our 95% confidence interval
contains the possibility that the true probability is less than 0.5.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, the data we collected is inconclusive.  We
would need additional testing to determine the optimal index page
version.</p>
